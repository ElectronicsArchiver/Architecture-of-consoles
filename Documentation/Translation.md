# Translation   [![Badge Crowdin]][Crowdin]

Thank you for taking interest in bringing <br>
these articles to a wider audience.

<br>

## Introduction

Within the `articles` folder you'll find the English <br>
writings, while translated articles are found in the <br>
`translations` subdirectory.

To start localizing, please visit our **[Crowdin]** page, <br>
choose a language + article and let Crowdin guide <br>
you through the process.

Additional files to be translated:

- `resources/generations.yaml`
- `resources/strings.toml`
- `articles/_index.md`

When you finish translating a document, please drop <br>
me an email (address in the website) or open an issue <br>
here so I can review it and deploy it.

*Feel free to ask me for help if you need.*

<br>
<br>

## Guidelines

Translating can get messy, so these are the <br>
guidelines to help keep the content consistent:

-   Common tech terminology is tricky to translate, <br>
    sometimes it can be translated, sometimes not. 
    
    If in doubt, just leave it as is.

-   Some unique names may seem 'translatable' <br>
    ( i.e. the 'Scalar Unit' of the Nintendo 64 ) <br>
    however they shoudln't be translated, since <br>
    it's a term used to identify that component <br>
    and no other.

-   Some sentences structures may only sound <br>
    natural in English, in those cases feel free to <br>
    re-construct them if you find a better form in <br>
    your language.

-   Blocks of **[Hugo]** syntax only require `name=""` <br>
    and `alt=""` values to be translated, the rest <br>
    should stay as it is.
    
<br>

I hope I don't sound bossy with this, I'm actually very <br>
grateful to anyone that helps me improve the site!

Finally, don't forget to sign the **[Authors]** <br>
log with your name and, again, feel free <br>
to give me a shout if you need help.

<br>
<br>

## Updating

It's not very often, but I may add some new content to <br>
an existing article that has been translated already.

In this case, I can only maintain:

- `English`
- `Spanish`
- `Catalan`

For the rest of languages, Crowdin can notify previous <br>
translators whenever there's new changes detected.

As a rule of thumb, please check beforehand that the <br>
article you are interested in translating doesn't have <br>
many issues logged, this way you'll see which ones are <br>
meant to stay as they are.

***Thanks!***
