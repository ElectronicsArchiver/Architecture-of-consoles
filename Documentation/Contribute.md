## Localization

With all the traffic that's been going to the website I thought <br>
this would be an opportunity to enable readers from anywhere <br>
in the world to help translate the content, helping it to reach <br>
the widest possible audience.

## Corrections  /  Additions

Likewise, if you think there's a mistake - whether it's a technicality <br>
or involves multiple lines of text - open an issue so we can discuss it.

I don't recommend submitting a pull request right away since we <br>
may have a disagreement and I don't want you to waste your time!

*But I'm very open to any discussion.*
